# Maze App
This project is part of the course: advanced subjects in programming, which we need to create, manage and solve mazes.
the first part of this project is to generate 2 types of mazes:
first is SimpleMazeGenerator which generate the maze randomely
second is MyMazeGenerator which generate the maze with Prim algorithm.
Then the maze should be solved with one of three algorithms: BFS, DFS and Best First Search.

The second part of the project is to create Client Server structure with threads. 
Multiple clients can send requests to the server for maze creation. 
Clients also can send a maze to the server and the server will respond with the solution for the maze.

The third part of the project is to create a GUI for the app with JavaFX.

# AdvancedProgramingProject
This project is part of the course: advanced subjects in programming, which we need to create, manage and solve mazes.
the first part of this project is to generate 2 types of mazes:
first is SimpleMazeGenerator which generate the maze randomely
second is MyMazeGenerator which generate the maze with Prim algorithm.
